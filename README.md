# Estimating Vegetation Data From Remote Sensing Data
## Structure
Pre-processing is done via the pre-process.ipynb notebook (for which you need quite a chunk of the [`BigEarthNet dataset `](https://bigearth.net/#downloads)). The training of the networks is done via the `new_network.py`, `freeze_network.py` and `init_network.py`.

Other files were auxiliary to us in setting up data and running the experiments.
